*This project was built over the night of 5th October and the morning of the 6th at Tinkerspace, as part of a Saturday Hacknight.*

# Period tracker
Through this project, we tried to build a period tracker and a mood tracker. Here, we can add the average duration of each cycle and the duration between each cycles. With that data, upon selecting a start date for a period, the system will automatically mark the upcoming days as the cycle. The user can mark when her period has ended.

# Framework used
Next.JS 14.2.4
